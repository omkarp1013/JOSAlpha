# JOS-Alpha
This repository contains an alpha (trading strategy) submitted to the UMD Smith Investment Fund's alpha competition. JOS = James, Omkar, Suryaa. It also contains an experimental model used for sentiment analysis on Tweets (although this was not used as part of the alpha and was a separate side project). Feel free to contact me or any of my teammates about the code.
